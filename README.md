# Workshop In PIR (WIP)

PIR papers published in the last decade have been scattered across a variety of systems and cryptography venues. There has not been a 'central place' for collaboration on the problem. This is reflected in a lack of knowledge sharing between different constructions, and that the sometimes complex interactions between different component constructions feel under-explored.

WIP is designed as a place to share early work, direction, and theories for successful PIR construction. In doing so, we hope to provide a point of coordination for PIR researchers, and grow a more vibrant community working on the PIR problem.

WIP is scoped to cover active systems and cryptographic research relevant to the problem of private information retrieval - accessing a member element from a collection while controlling metadata leakage.

## Important Dates:

* May 20th: Workshop announced
* June 20th: Program Announced
* **July 15th**: PETS workshops, including WIP

## Registration:

Workshop registration is £75. Registration and logistical details can be found at https://petsymposium.org/2024/registration.php

## Program:

The schedule is at https://github.com/private-retrieval/wip/blob/main/schedule.md

## Organisation / Programme committee
* David Wu (UT Austin)
* Shannon Veitch (ETH Zurich)
* Elaine Shi (CMU)
* Sebastian Angel (U Penn)
* Ling Ren (UIUC)

## Target audience
Current practitioners and researchers in and adjacent to Private Information Retrieval Systems. Audience includes and is not limited to homomorphic encryption and Lattice based constructions. Related problems like Private Set Intersection constructions are also considered in scope.

## Publication plans
For the first instance, we don’t anticipate having published proceedings.

## Contingency plan
If PETs does not occur, a subset of the program will occur in an online format.
